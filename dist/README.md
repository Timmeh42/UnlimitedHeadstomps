# UnlimitedHeadstomps

Risk of Rain 2 mod to remove the cooldown on the Headstompers / H3AD-5T v2

 - H3AD-5T v2 by default reduces its cooldown by half for each stack of the item.
 - It's rare to get more than one stack of this item, and the damage output is very low considering how they have to be used.
 - Therefore, it doesn't seem imbalanced to remove the cooldown entirely.


### Installation

- Requires BepInEx
- Copy the dll to the BepinEx plugins folder
